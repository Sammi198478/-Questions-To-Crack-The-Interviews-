    <!--1/What is HTML? Explain its purpose & Basic Syntax Of HTML ? -->
    <h1>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language used to create and design documents on the web. It provides the structure for web pages by using a system of tags and attributes that define the content and layout.</h1>
    <!--Purpose of HTML-->
    <p>Structure Content: HTML allows developers to organize content into elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images, and more.

        Create Links: HTML facilitates navigation between different pages and websites through hyperlinks.
        
        Embed Media: HTML enables the inclusion of multimedia elements such as images, videos, and audio.
        
        Form Creation: HTML is used to create forms for user input, allowing interaction with web applications.
        
        Semantic Meaning: HTML provides a way to add meaning to content (e.g., distinguishing between a heading and a paragraph), which can improve accessibility and SEO.</p>
        <!--Basic Syntax of HTML-->
        <h2><!DOCTYPE html></h2>


        <!--2/What are HTML tags? How are they structured? Give Us 5 Tags As A Example. -->
        <p>HTML tags are the building blocks of HTML, used to create elements on a web page. Tags usually come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag, with content in between. The opening tag defines the start of an element, while the closing tag indicates the end of that element. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets (< >).</p>
        <!--Structure of HTML Tags-->
        <p>Opening Tag: Indicates the beginning of an element. For example, <tagname>.
            Content: The text or other elements contained within the tags.
            Closing Tag: Indicates the end of an element, written as </tagname>.</p>
        <!--Here are five common HTML tags:-->
        <!--Paragraph Tag (<p>)-->
            <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
        <!--Heading Tags (<h1> to <h6>)-->
            <h1>This is a Heading 1</h1>
            <h2>This is a Heading 2</h2>
        <!--Anchor Tag (<a>)-->
            <a href="https://www.example.com">This is a link</a>
        <!--Image Tag (<img>)-->
        <img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of image">
        <!--List Tags (<ul>, <ol>, <li>)-->
            <ul>
                <li>Item 1</li>
                <li>Item 2</li>
            </ul>


    <!--3/What is the difference between <head>, <body>, and <html> tags? & the role of the <!DOCTYPE html> declaration?-->
        <!--The <head>, <body>, and <html> tags serve distinct purposes in an HTML document. -->
            <p><head> Tag
                Purpose: The <head> tag contains metadata and information about the document that isn’t displayed directly on the web page. This includes the title, character set, links to stylesheets, scripts, and other meta information.
                Structure: The content inside the <head> tag helps the browser and search engines understand the document.</p>
                    <p>Example:</p>
                    <head>
                        <title>My Web Page</title>
                        <meta charset="UTF-8">
                        <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
                    </head>
            <p><body> Tag
                Purpose: The <body> tag contains all the content that is visible to users, such as text, images, links, and other interactive elements.
                Structure: Everything inside the <body> tag is rendered by the browser and displayed to users.</p>
                    <p>Example:</p>
                    <body>
                        <h1>Welcome to My Web Page</h1>
                        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
                    </body>
            <p><html> Tag
                Purpose: The <html> tag is the root element of an HTML document. It wraps all other content on the page.
                Structure: It indicates that the content inside is an HTML document.</p>
                <p>Example:</p>
                <html>
                 <!-- Other elements go here -->
               </html>

               <p>Role of <!DOCTYPE html>
                Purpose: The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines the document type and version of HTML being used. It tells the browser to render the page in standards mode and ensures compatibility with HTML5.
                Importance: Including this declaration is essential for the browser to interpret the document correctly and apply the right rendering rules.</p>
                <p>Example:</p>
                <p><!DOCTYPE html></p>
    <!--The <html> tag encompasses the entire HTML document.
       The <head> tag contains metadata and links, while the <body> tag holds the visible content.
       The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration signals to the browser that the document is an HTML5 document, which is crucial for proper rendering.-->


<!--4/Describe the function of the <title> tag. Where does it appear With Example. -->
    <p>
        The <title> tag is used to define the title of an HTML document. This title appears in the browser's title bar or tab, and it is also used by search engines as the clickable headline for search results. Additionally, the title is important for accessibility, as it provides context to users about the content of the page</p>
            <p>
                Function of the <title> Tag
                    Browser Display: The text inside the <title> tag is shown in the browser’s title bar or tab, helping users identify the page they are viewing.
                    
                    SEO: Search engines use the title to index and rank web pages. A well-crafted title can improve the page's visibility in search results.
                    
                    Bookmarking: When users bookmark a page, the title is often used as the default name for the bookmark.
                    
                    Accessibility: Screen readers may read the title to provide context to visually impaired users.
            </p>
            <p>
                Where It Appears
                The <title> tag is placed within the <head> section of an HTML document. It does not display the title on the web page itself; instead, it is part of the document’s metadata.
            </p>
            <p>Example:</p>
            <div>
                <!DOCTYPE html>
                 <html>
              <head>
           <title>Welcome to My Website</title>
           <meta charset="UTF-8">
           </head>
        <body>
        <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
         <p>This is my first web page.</p>
      </body>
      </html>
            </div>
            <p>
                The title "Welcome to My Website" will appear in the browser’s title bar or tab.
                This title helps users understand what the page is about before they even read the content. 
            </p>


    <!--5/How do you add comments in HTML, and why are they useful?-->
    <p>In HTML, comments are added using the following syntax:</p>
    <!-- This is a comment -->
     <p>
        How to Add Comments
        Single-Line Comment: You can add comments anywhere in your HTML code, and they will not affect the rendering of the page
     </p>
     <p>Example:</p>
     <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1> <!-- This is a header -->
     <p>
        Multi-Line Comment: Comments can span multiple lines:
     </p>
     <!--
    This is a multi-line comment.
    It can span several lines.
      -->
    <p>
        Why Comments Are Useful
        Documentation: Comments help document the code, explaining what specific sections do. This is especially helpful for larger projects or when working in teams.

        Code Clarity: By providing explanations or notes, comments can make the code easier to understand for anyone who reads it later, including yourself.

        Debugging: Comments can be used to temporarily disable sections of code without deleting them, which can be useful during debugging.

        Organization: Comments can help organize your code into sections, making it easier to navigate and maintain.
    </p>

    <!--Step 2-->
    <!--6/What is the difference between an HTML element and an HTML attribute give us example with proper Explanation. -->
        <p>
            In HTML, elements and attributes are two fundamental components that work together to create web pages. Here's a breakdown of their differences along with examples for better understanding.
        </p>
        <p>
            HTML Element
            An HTML element is a complete component of a webpage, consisting of a start tag, optional content, and an end tag. Elements represent various parts of the document, such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more.

             Structure of an HTML Element
             Opening Tag: Indicates the start of the element (e.g., <p>).
             Content: The text or other elements contained within the tags.
             Closing Tag: Indicates the end of the element (e.g., </p>).
        </p>
        <p>Example of an HTML Element</p>
        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
        <h3>
            In this example:
            <p> is the opening tag.
             This is a paragraph. is the content.
             </p> is the closing tag.
             The entire <p>This is a paragraph.</p> is the HTML element.
        </h3>

        <p>
            HTML Attribute
            An HTML attribute provides additional information about an element. Attributes are always specified in the opening tag and usually come in name/value pairs (e.g., name="value").

            Structure of an HTML Attribute
            Name: The name of the attribute (e.g., href).
            Value: The value assigned to the attribute, enclosed in quotes (e.g., "https://www.example.com").
        </p>
        <p>Example of an HTML Element with Attributes</p>
        <a href="https://www.example.com" target="_blank">Visit Example</a>
        <p>
            In this example:
            <a> is the opening tag of the anchor element (link).
            href="https://www.example.com" is an attribute that specifies the URL the link points to.
            target="_blank" is another attribute that specifies that the link should open in a new tab.
            Visit Example is the content of the link.
            </a> is the closing tag.
            The entire <a href="https://www.example.com" target="_blank">Visit Example</a> is the HTML element, which includes attributes.
        </p>

        <p>
            Summary of Differences
            HTML Element: Represents a specific part of the webpage and consists of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag.
            HTML Attribute: Provides additional information about an element, specified within the opening tag, usually in name/value pairs.
            Understanding the difference between elements and attributes is crucial for structuring and enhancing HTML documents effectively.
        </p>



    <!--7/Explain the global attributes in HTML, such as class, id, style, and title With Example.-->
    <p>
        Global attributes in HTML are attributes that can be applied to any HTML element, allowing for more flexibility and control over the elements in a document. Here’s an overview of some common global attributes, including class, id, style, and title, along with examples.
    </p>
    <p>
        class
        Purpose: The class attribute is used to assign one or more class names to an element. This is useful for applying CSS styles and selecting elements with JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <p class="highlight">This paragraph is highlighted.</p>
    <!--In this example, the paragraph element has a class called "highlight," which can be styled in CSS.-->
    <p>
        id
        Purpose: The id attribute is used to assign a unique identifier to an element. It should be unique within the document and can be used to apply styles or select the element with JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <h1 id="main-title">Welcome to My Website</h1>
    <!--Here, the heading element has an id of "main-title," which can be targeted specifically for styling or scripting.-->
    <p>
        style
        Purpose: The style attribute allows you to apply inline CSS styles directly to an element. While it can be convenient, it’s generally better to use external or internal stylesheets for maintainability.
    </p>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <div style="background-color: lightblue; padding: 20px;">This is a styled div.</div>
    <!--In this case, the div element has inline styles that set the background color and padding.-->
    <p>
        title
        Purpose: The title attribute provides additional information about an element, typically displayed as a tooltip when the user hovers over the element. It can enhance accessibility by providing context.
    </p>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <!--When users hover over the link, a tooltip will appear with the text "Visit Example Website," giving more context about the link.-->
    <p>
        class: Assigns one or more class names for CSS styling or JavaScript targeting.
        id: Provides a unique identifier for an element, allowing for specific targeting in styles or scripts.
        style: Applies inline CSS styles directly to an element.
        title: Offers additional information displayed as a tooltip when hovering over the element.
        These global attributes enhance the functionality and styling capabilities of HTML elements, making it easier to create interactive and visually appealing web pages.
    </p>


    <!--8/What is the purpose of the alt attribute in an <img> tag?-->
    <p>The alt attribute in an <img> tag serves several important purposes:</p>
    <p>
        Purpose of the alt Attribute
        Text Alternative: The primary purpose of the alt attribute (short for "alternative text") is to provide a textual description of the image. This is crucial for users who cannot see the image, including those using screen readers or those who have images disabled in their browsers.

        Accessibility: By describing the content or function of the image, the alt attribute enhances accessibility. It ensures that visually impaired users have a better understanding of the context and meaning of images on a webpage.

        SEO Benefits: Search engines use the alt text to understand the content of images. Including relevant keywords can improve a page's SEO, helping it rank better in search results.

        Error Handling: If an image fails to load, the text specified in the alt attribute will be displayed in place of the image. This informs users about what was intended to be shown.
    </p>
    <p>Example of the alt Attribute</p>
    <img src="cat.jpg" alt="A cute orange tabby cat sitting on a windowsill">
    <!--In this example:
     src="cat.jpg" specifies the source of the image.
     alt="A cute orange tabby cat sitting on a windowsill" provides a description of the image.-->
     <p>
        The alt attribute is essential for creating accessible and user-friendly web content. It helps convey the purpose of images to all users, enhances SEO, and provides a fallback in case images do not load. Always strive to use descriptive and meaningful text in the alt attribute to maximize its benefits.
     </p>



     <!--9/Describe the href attribute and its role in the <a> tag? -->
        <p>The href attribute in the <a> (anchor) tag is crucial for defining the destination of a hyperlink. Here’s a detailed look at its role and usage.</p>
            <p>
                Purpose of the href Attribute
             Link Destination: The primary function of the href attribute is to specify the URL or path to the resource that the link points to. This could be a webpage, an image, a file, an email address, or any other type of resource.

            Navigation: When users click on a link, the browser navigates to the URL specified in the href attribute. This facilitates seamless movement between different pages or sections of a website.

            Types of Links: The href attribute can be used to create different types of links:
            </p>
            <p>Absolute URL: Links to a complete web address</p>
            <a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example</a>
            <p>Relative URL: Links to a resource within the same website</p>
            <a href="/about">About Us</a>
            <p>Anchor Link: Links to a specific section within the same page using an ID</p>
            <a href="#section1">Go to Section 1</a>
            <p>Email Link: Links that open the user's email client</p>
            <a href="mailto:example@example.com">Email Us</a>
            <p>File Link: Links to downloadable files</p>
            <a href="files/report.pdf">Download Report</a>
            <p>Example of the href Attribute</p>
            <a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example</a>
            <!--In this example:
            The text "Visit Example" is clickable.
            Clicking this link will navigate the user to https://www.example.com.-->
            <p>
                The href attribute is essential for the <a> tag, as it defines where the link will lead when clicked. It allows for various types of links, enabling users to navigate easily through websites, access external resources, and interact with content. Always ensure that the URLs provided in the href attribute are correct and functional to enhance user experience.
            </p>
    

    <!--1o/How does the target attribute work within an <a> tag? What is _blank?-->
        <p>
            The target attribute in an <a> (anchor) tag specifies how the linked document should be opened when the link is clicked. It controls the browsing context in which the linked resource will be displayed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Common Values for the target Attribute
            _self (default): Opens the link in the same browsing context (the same tab or window). This is the default behavior if the target attribute is not specified. 
        </p>
        <a href="https://www.example.com" target="_self">Visit Example</a>
        <p>
            _blank: Opens the link in a new tab or window. This is useful for keeping the current page open while allowing users to view the linked content simultaneously.
        </p>
        <a href="https://www.example.com" target="_blank">Visit Example in a New Tab</a>
        <p>
            _parent: Opens the link in the parent frame. If there is no parent frame, it behaves like _self.
        </p>
        <a href="https://www.example.com" target="_parent">Visit Example</a>
        <p>
            _top: Opens the link in the full body of the window, effectively removing any frames (if frames are being used).
        </p>
        <a href="https://www.example.com" target="_top">Visit Example</a>
        <p>
            Example Using _blank
            Here’s how you can use the target attribute with _blank:
        </p>
        <a href="https://www.example.com" target="_blank">Visit Example</a>
        <!--In this example:
        Clicking the link will open https://www.example.com in a new tab or window, depending on the user's browser settings.-->
        <p>
            Importance of Using _blank
            Using _blank is beneficial in scenarios where you want to provide users with additional resources or information without disrupting their current activity on your site. However, it’s important to use it judiciously, as opening too many new tabs can be overwhelming for users.
        </p>
        <p>
            Security Consideration
            When using target="_blank", it’s recommended to also include the rel attribute with the value noopener or noreferrer. This prevents the newly opened page from having access to the window.opener property, which can mitigate security risks related to tab hijacking.
        </p>
        <a href="https://www.example.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Visit Example</a>
        <p>
            The target attribute in an <a> tag controls how a linked document is opened. Using _blank opens links in a new tab or window, enhancing user experience by allowing simultaneous access to multiple pages. Always consider security practices when using this attribute.
        </p>

    <!--11/How to add favicon in HTML & Why ?-->
    <p>

       A favicon (short for "favorite icon") is a small icon associated with a website, typically displayed in the browser's address bar, tabs, bookmarks, and history. Adding a favicon enhances your site's branding and helps users easily identify your site among multiple open tabs.
    </p>
    <p>
        How to Add a Favicon in HTML
        To add a favicon to your website, you typically use the <link> tag in the <head> section of your HTML document. Here’s how to do it:

        Create a Favicon: Create a square image (usually 16x16 or 32x32 pixels) in .ico, .png, or .gif format. The .ico format is widely supported, but modern browsers also support .png files.

        Upload the Favicon: Upload the favicon file to the root directory of your website or to a designated folder.

        Add the <link> Tag: Include the following code in the <head> section of your HTML:
    </p>
    <!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Your Website Title</title>
    <link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon"> <!-- For .ico file -->
    <!-- or -->
    <link rel="icon" href="favicon.png" type="image/png"> <!-- For .png file -->
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Page content -->
</body>
</html>
       <p>
        Explanation of the <link> Tag
        rel="icon": Specifies the relationship of the linked resource as an icon.
        href="favicon.ico": Specifies the path to the favicon file. Make sure the path is correct based on where you uploaded the favicon.
        type="image/x-icon": (optional) Specifies the MIME type of the icon. This is particularly useful for .ico files. For .png files, you can use type="image/png".
       </p>
       <p>
        Why Add a Favicon?
        Branding: A favicon helps establish your brand identity. A recognizable icon makes your site stand out and can enhance brand recall.

        User Experience: Favicons improve user experience by making it easier for visitors to locate your site in their browser’s tab, bookmarks, or history.

        Professional Appearance: Including a favicon gives your site a more polished and professional look, which can enhance trustworthiness in the eyes of users.

        Multi-Tab Browsing: In environments where users may have many tabs open, a favicon allows them to quickly identify and switch to your site.
       </p>
       <p>
        To add a favicon to your HTML, use the <link> tag in the <head> section, pointing to the image file. A favicon is essential for branding, improving user experience, and giving your site a professional appearance.

    <!--12/What is formatting in HTML?-->
       <p>

         Formatting in HTML refers to the way text and other elements are styled and structured to enhance readability and presentation on a web page. It involves using various HTML tags to control the appearance and layout of content, ensuring that it is visually appealing and easy to navigate. Here’s a breakdown of key aspects of formatting in HTML:
       </p>
       <h2>Key Aspects of Formatting in HTML</h2>
       <p>Headings: Use <h1> to <h6> tags for headings of different levels</p>
        
            <h1>Main Title</h1>
            <h2>Subheading</h2>
        <p>Paragraphs: The <p> tag is used for paragraphs</p>
        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
        <p>Bold and Italics: Use <strong> for bold text and <em> for italics</p>
            <strong>Bold Text</strong> and <em>Italic Text</em>
        <p>Lists: HTML supports both ordered (<ol>) and unordered (<ul>) lists, with list items marked by</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Item 1</li>
                <li>Item 2</li>
            </ul>
        <p>Links and Anchors: The <a> tag is used for hyperlinks, allowing users to navigate to other pages or resources.</p>
            <a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example</a>
        <p>Images: The <img> tag allows you to include images, which can enhance the visual appeal of your content.</p>
        <img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of image">
        <p>Tables: HTML tables are created using <table>, <tr> (table row), <th> (table header), and <td> (table data) tags to organize data in a grid format.</p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Header 1</th>
                    <th>Header 2</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Data 1</td>
                    <td>Data 2</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
        <p>
            Block vs. Inline Elements: Understanding the difference between block-level elements (e.g., <div>, <p>, <h1>) and inline elements (e.g., <span>, <a>, <img>) is essential for formatting. Block elements take up the full width available, while inline elements only take up as much width as necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
            Importance of Formatting
            Readability: Proper formatting enhances the readability of text and makes it easier for users to find information quickly.
            Visual Hierarchy: Formatting creates a visual hierarchy, guiding users through the content in a structured manner.
            User Experience: Well-formatted content improves user experience, making it more likely that users will stay on the page and engage with the content.
            Branding: Consistent formatting helps establish brand identity and professionalism.
        </p>
        <p>
            Formatting in HTML involves using various tags to style and structure text, images, lists, tables, and links. It is essential for creating visually appealing and user-friendly web pages that enhance readability and overall user experience.

    <!--13/What Is Inline and block elements in html5 Give Us The Proper Explain With Example? -->
    <p>
        In HTML5, elements are categorized into two main types based on their display behavior: block elements and inline elements. Understanding the difference between these two types is crucial for effective web design and layout.
    </p>
    <p>
        Block Elements
        Block elements are those that take up the full width of their parent container. They start on a new line and stack vertically, meaning that subsequent elements appear below them.
    </p>
    <p>
        Characteristics of Block Elements:
        Occupy the entire width available (by default).
        Always start on a new line.
        Can contain other block and inline elements.
    </p>
    <p>
        Common Block Elements:
       <div>: A generic container for grouping elements.
       <p>: Defines a paragraph.
       <h1> to <h6>: Headings of different levels.
       <ul>: Unordered list.
       <ol>: Ordered list.
       <table>: Table structure.
    </p>
    <p>Example of Block Elements:</p>
    <div>
        <h1>Main Title</h1>
        <p>This is a paragraph that explains something important.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Item 1</li>
            <li>Item 2</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p>
        Inline Elements
        Inline elements are those that only take up as much width as their content requires. They do not start on a new line, allowing other elements to appear beside them.
    </p>
    <p>
        Characteristics of Inline Elements:
        Occupy only the space required by their content.
        Do not start on a new line.
        Can contain only inline elements (not block elements).
    </p>
    <p>
        Common Inline Elements:
        <span>: A generic container for inline text.
        <a>: Anchor tag for hyperlinks.
        <img>: Image tag.
        <strong>: Bold text.
        <em>: Italic text.
    </p>
    <p>Example of Inline Elements:</p>
    <p>This is a <strong>bold</strong> word and this is an <a href="#">inline link</a>.</p>
    <img src="image.jpg" alt="Description" style="width: 50px;">
    <p>
        Practical Use
        Block elements are typically used for larger structural elements of a page, such as sections, paragraphs, and headings.
        Inline elements are used for smaller pieces of content within block elements, such as links, emphasized text, and images within paragraphs.
    </p>
    <p>
        Understanding the distinction between block and inline elements helps in creating well-structured and visually appealing web pages.
    </p>


    <!--14/What is a marquee?-->
    <p>
        A marquee is an HTML element that creates a scrolling text or image effect across the webpage. It was used to display information in a moving fashion, typically scrolling horizontally or vertically. The <marquee> tag was introduced in early versions of HTML, but it is not a part of the official HTML standards in HTML5 and is considered deprecated.
    </p>
    <p>
        Characteristics of the <marquee> Element
            Scrolling Text/Image: The primary purpose is to create a scrolling effect for text or images, drawing attention to specific information.
            
            Direction: You can control the direction of the scrolling (left, right, up, down) using the direction attribute.
            
            Speed and Behavior: Attributes such as scrollamount (speed of the scroll), scrolldelay (delay between scrolls), and loop (number of times the marquee should repeat) can also be specified.
    </p>
    <p>Basic Example of a Marquee</p>
    <marquee direction="left" scrollamount="5" behavior="scroll">
        This is a scrolling message!
    </marquee>
    <p>
        Attributes
      direction: Specifies the direction of the scroll (e.g., left, right, up, down).
      scrollamount: Specifies the speed of the scrolling. Higher values result in faster scrolling.
      scrolldelay: Sets the delay between each scroll movement.
      loop: Determines how many times the marquee should loop (or set to infinite).
    </p>
    <p>Example with Multiple Attributes</p>
    <marquee direction="right" scrollamount="10" behavior="alternate" loop="infinite">
        This message will scroll back and forth!
    </marquee>
    <p>
        A marquee is an HTML element used for scrolling text or images, but it is deprecated in HTML5. For better accessibility and performance, consider using CSS animations or JavaScript to achieve similar scrolling effects in a more standards-compliant way.
    </p>



    <!--15/Explain the difference between <p>, <span>, and <div> tags. When would you use each?-->
        <p>
            The <p>, <span>, and <div> tags in HTML serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics. Understanding their differences helps in structuring your HTML effectively.
        </p>
        <p>
            <p> Tag
                Purpose: The <p> tag is used to define a paragraph of text. It automatically adds some spacing (margins) before and after the text, making it ideal for blocks of text.
                Display Behavior: Block-level element. It starts on a new line and takes up the full width of its container.
        </p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>This is a paragraph of text that explains something important.</p>
        <p>
            When to Use:
            Use <p> for any standalone blocks of text that form paragraphs, such as articles, blog posts, or any section of text that conveys a complete thought.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span> Tag
                Purpose: The <span> tag is an inline container used to apply styles or scripts to a specific portion of text without affecting the surrounding text structure.
                Display Behavior: Inline element. It does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as its content requires.
        </p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>This is a <span style="color: red;">highlighted</span> word in a paragraph.</p>
        <p>
            When to Use:
            Use <span> for styling small portions of text within other elements, such as changing the color or font of specific words without altering the overall structure of the surrounding content.
        </p>
        <p>
            <div> Tag
                Purpose: The <div> tag is a generic block-level container that groups elements together for styling or scripting purposes. It does not inherently represent anything and is often used for layout purposes.
                Display Behavior: Block-level element. Like <p>, it starts on a new line and takes up the full width of its container.
        </p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <div class="container">
            <h2>Section Title</h2>
            <p>This is a paragraph within a div container.</p>
            
        </div>
        <p>
            When to Use:
            Use <div> to group larger sections of content, such as multiple paragraphs, images, or other elements that need to be styled or manipulated together. It’s commonly used in layout structures, like creating sections of a webpage.
        </p>
        <p>
            Practical Use Cases
            Use <p> for standard paragraphs in your content.
            Use <span> for inline styling, like highlighting specific words or phrases within paragraphs.
            Use <div> for structural layout and to group multiple elements together for styling or scripting purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
            By using these tags appropriately, you can create well-structured, accessible, and maintainable HTML documents.
        </p>


    <!--16/Describe the <ul>, <ol>, and <li> tags for creating lists.-->
        <p>
            The <ul>, <ol>, and <li> tags are used in HTML to create lists, which help organize content in a structured manner. Here’s a detailed explanation of each tag:
        </p>
        <p>
            <ul> Tag (Unordered List)
                Purpose: The <ul> tag is used to create an unordered list, which displays items in no particular order. Items in an unordered list are typically represented with bullet points.
                Display Behavior: Block-level element.
        </p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Item 1</li>
            <li>Item 2</li>
            <li>Item 3</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Output:
            • Item 1
            • Item 2
            • Item 3
        </p>
        <p>
            <ol> Tag (Ordered List)
                Purpose: The <ol> tag is used to create an ordered list, where the items are displayed in a specific sequence. Items in an ordered list are typically represented with numbers or letters.
                Display Behavior: Block-level element.
        </p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>First item</li>
            <li>Second item</li>
            <li>Third item</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Output:
            First item
            Second item
            Third item
        </p>
        <p>
            . <li> Tag (List Item)
                Purpose: The <li> tag is used to define individual items within both unordered (<ul>) and ordered lists (<ol>). Each <li> tag represents a single item in the list.
                Display Behavior: Block-level element when used within <ul> or <ol>, but inline when nested in other contexts.
        </p>
        <p>Example in Both Lists:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Apple</li>
            <li>Banana</li>
            <li>Cherry</li>
        </ul>
        
        <ol>
            <li>First Step</li>
            <li>Second Step</li>
            <li>Third Step</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Key Differences Between <ul> and <ol>
                Type of List:
                
                <ul>: Unordered (bullets)
                <ol>: Ordered (numbers or letters)
                Usage:
                
                Use <ul> for lists where the order of items doesn’t matter (e.g., shopping lists).
                Use <ol> for lists where the order is important (e.g., steps in a process).
        </p>
        <p>
            Nested Lists
            You can also create nested lists by placing a <ul> or <ol> inside a <li>:
        </p>
        <p>Example of a Nested List:</p> 
        <ol>
            <li>Step 1
                <ul>
                    <li>Subitem 1a</li>
                    <li>Subitem 1b</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Step 2</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <ul>: Creates an unordered list with bullet points.
                <ol>: Creates an ordered list with numbers or letters.
                <li>: Defines individual list items within either type of list.
                Using these list tags effectively helps in organizing information, making it easier for users to read and understand content on a webpage. 
        </p>



    <!--17/Describe how <input> works and some of its types, such as text, radio, and checkbox.-->
    <p>
        The <input> tag in HTML is a versatile element used to create interactive controls in web forms, allowing users to input data. It can represent various types of input fields depending on the type attribute specified. Here’s a detailed explanation of how the <input> tag works and some of its common types, including text, radio, and checkbox.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <input> tag is a self-closing tag that typically includes several attributes:

        type: Specifies the type of input control (e.g., text, radio).
        name: Identifies the input field, used when submitting the form data.
        value: Defines the default value for the input (for certain types).
        id: Provides a unique identifier for the input element, useful for labeling and scripting.
        placeholder: Displays a hint about the expected input in the field.
    </p>
    <p>
        Common Input Types
       1. Text Input
       Type: text
       Purpose: Allows users to enter a single line of text.
    </p>
    <p>Example:

    </p>
    <input type="text" name="username" placeholder="Enter your username">
    <p>
        Radio Button
        Type: radio
        Purpose: Allows users to select one option from a set of predefined options. All radio buttons with the same name belong to the same group, ensuring that only one can be selected at a time. 
    </p>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <label>
        <input type="radio" name="gender" value="male"> Male
    </label>
    <label>
        <input type="radio" name="gender" value="female"> Female
    </label>
    <p>
        Checkbox
        Type: checkbox
        Purpose: Allows users to select one or more options from a set. Each checkbox operates independently, meaning multiple checkboxes in a group can be selected at once.
    </p>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <label>
        <input type="checkbox" name="subscribe" value="yes"> Subscribe to newsletter
    </label>
    <label>
        <input type="checkbox" name="updates" value="yes"> Receive updates
    </label>
    <p>
        Additional Input Types
       Here are a few other common input types:

       Password: Masks the input, suitable for sensitive information like passwords.
    </p>
    <input type="password" name="password" placeholder="Enter your password">
    <p>Email: Validates that the input is formatted as an email address.</p>
    <input type="email" name="email" placeholder="Enter your email">
    <p>Number: Allows numerical input and can include attributes like min, max, and step for range control.</p>
    <input type="number" name="age" min="1" max="100" placeholder="Enter your age">
    <p>Date: Provides a date picker for selecting a date.</p>
    <input type="date" name="birthdate">
    <p>
        The <input> tag is fundamental for creating interactive forms in HTML. Different input types, such as text, radio, and checkbox, enable varied user interactions, allowing for data collection and user input in a structured way. By specifying the type attribute, you can control the behavior and appearance of the input field to suit your needs.
    </p>

            <option value="banana">Banana</option>
            <option value="cherry">Cherry</option>
        </select>
        <p>
            Using <select> with Multiple Selections
                If you want to allow users to select multiple options, you can use the multiple attribute:
        </p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <select name="fruits" multiple>
            <option value="apple">Apple</option>
            <option value="banana">Banana</option>
            <option value="cherry">Cherry</option>
        </select>
        <p>
            <button>: Creates a clickable button for various actions, including form submission and custom JavaScript functions.
                <textarea>: Provides a multi-line text input area for larger text entries, such as comments or messages.
                <select>: Creates a drop-down list for users to select one or more options from a set of predefined choices.
                These elements enhance the functionality of forms and improve user interaction on web pages, making it easier to collect and manage user input effectively.

    <!--19/How to link CSS to HTML?-->
    <p>
        Linking CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) to HTML allows you to style your web pages, controlling the appearance of elements like fonts, colors, layouts, and more. There are three primary methods to link CSS to HTML:
    </p>
    <p>
        External CSS
        This is the most common and efficient method, especially for larger websites. You create a separate CSS file and link it to your HTML document using the <link> tag in the <head> section.
    </p>
    <p>
        Steps:
        Create a CSS file (e.g., styles.css).
        Add your CSS styles to that file.
        Link the CSS file in your HTML using the <link> tag.
    </p>
    <p>Example:</p>
    body {
        background-color: lightblue;
        font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    }
    
    h1 {
        color: navy;
    }
    <p>
        Internal CSS
        You can also write CSS directly within the HTML document using a <style> tag in the <head> section. This method is useful for small styles or when you only need specific styles for a single page.
    </p>
         <p>Example:</p>

    <title>My Web Page</title>
    <style>
        body {
            background-color: lightblue;
            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
        }
        h1 {
            color: navy;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Web Page</h1>
    <p>This is a sample paragraph.</p>

      <p>
        Inline CSS
        This method involves adding CSS styles directly to individual HTML elements using the style attribute. While this allows for very specific styling, it is not recommended for larger projects because it can make the HTML messy and harder to maintain.
      </p>
      <p>Example:</p>
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
      <title>My Web Page</title>
  </head>
  <body style="background-color: lightblue; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">
      <h1 style="color: navy;">Welcome to My Web Page</h1>
      <p>This is a sample paragraph.</p>

      <p>
        External CSS: Best for maintaining styles across multiple pages; linked via the <link> tag.
        Internal CSS: Useful for styling a single page; placed within a <style> tag in the <head>.
        Inline CSS: Applies styles to individual elements; specified using the style attribute, but not recommended for larger projects.
        Using these methods effectively will help you organize and manage your styles efficiently in your web projects.
    
      </p>
     

    
    <!--20/What is the <label> tag, and how is it associated with form inputs?-->
    <p>
            The <label> tag in HTML is used to define a label for an input element within a form. It improves accessibility and usability by providing a clear description of what the input field is for. When a user clicks on the label, it focuses the corresponding input field, which enhances the user experience.
            </p>
    <p>
        Key Features of the <label> Tag
       Association with Input Elements: The <label> can be associated with form controls (like <input>, <textarea>, and <select>) using the for attribute. This attribute should match the id of the input element.

       Accessibility: Labels improve accessibility for screen readers and assistive technologies, allowing users with disabilities to understand the purpose of form fields.

       User Interaction: Clicking on a label will focus the associated input field, making it easier for users to interact with forms.
        
        </p>
        <p>Basic Syntax</p>

        <label for="inputId">Label Text</label>
        <input type="text" id="inputId" name="inputName">
        <p>
            Example of Using the <label> Tag
                Here's a complete example that demonstrates how to use the <label> tag effectively:
            </p>
            <form>
    <label for="username">Username:</label>
    <input type="text" id="username" name="username" placeholder="Enter your username">

    <label for="password">Password:</label>
    <input type="password" id="password" name="password" placeholder="Enter your password">

    <label for="subscribe">
        <input type="checkbox" id="subscribe" name="subscribe" value="yes"> Subscribe to newsletter
    </label>

    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
     <p>
        Explanation of the Example
        Username Field: The label "Username:" is associated with the input field by using for="username", which matches the id of the <input>.
        Password Field: Similarly, the label for the password input provides clarity and focus.
        Checkbox: The label wraps the checkbox input, allowing the user to click either the label or the checkbox itself to select it.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <label> tag is essential for creating accessible and user-friendly forms. By associating labels with their corresponding input fields, you enhance the usability of your web forms, making it easier for all users to understand and interact with the input controls.
            </p>



    <!--Step 4-->
    <!--21/What is the <iframe> tag, and what are some common attributes used with it?-->
        <p>
            The <iframe> (inline frame) tag in HTML is used to embed another HTML document within the current document. This allows you to display content from another source, such as a different webpage, a video, a map, or any other HTML content, directly within your page.
            </p>
            <p>
                Basic Structure of <iframe>
                    The <iframe> tag is a self-closing tag and can include several attributes to customize its behavior and appearance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Common Attributes for <iframe>
                 src: Specifies the URL of the document to embed. This is the most important attribute as it tells the iframe where to load content from.

                 Example: <iframe src="https://www.example.com"></iframe>
                 width: Sets the width of the iframe in pixels or as a percentage of the parent container.

                 Example: <iframe src="example.html" width="600"></iframe>
                 height: Sets the height of the iframe in pixels.

                 Example: <iframe src="example.html" height="400"></iframe>
                 frameborder: Specifies whether to display a border around the iframe. The values can be 0 (no border) or 1 (with border). This attribute is deprecated in HTML5; use CSS for styling instead.

                 Example: <iframe src="example.html" frameborder="0"></iframe>
                allowfullscreen: Enables the iframe content to be displayed in full-screen mode.

                 Example: <iframe src="video.html" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                loading: Specifies whether the iframe should be loaded immediately or lazily. The values can be eager (load immediately) or lazy (load when it's in the viewport).

                Example: <iframe src="example.html" loading="lazy"></iframe>
               sandbox: Applies security restrictions to the iframe content. It can take various values, such as allow-scripts or allow-forms, to control what the embedded content can do.

              Example: <iframe src="example.html" sandbox="allow-scripts"></iframe>
             title: Provides a title for the iframe content, improving accessibility by describing the content for screen readers.

             Example: <iframe src="example.html" title="Description of content"></iframe>

             </p>
             <p>
                The <iframe> tag is a powerful tool for embedding external content within a webpage. By using attributes like src, width, height, and others, you can control how the iframe behaves and appears. It’s commonly used for embedding videos, maps, forms, and other interactive content, making it a versatile component in web design.
                </p>
       
       
       
<!--22/Describe how the <audio> and <video> tags work, including common attributes like controls, autoplay, and loop.-->
    <p>

      The <audio> and <video> tags in HTML are used to embed audio and video content in web pages, respectively. Both tags provide a standard way to include multimedia elements without relying on plugins like Flash. Here’s an overview of how they work, along with common attributes you can use to control their behavior.
        </p>
        <p>
            <audio> Tag
                The <audio> tag is used to embed sound content in a webpage. It supports various audio formats such as MP3, WAV, and Ogg
            </p>
            <p>Basic Syntax</p>
            /* <audio src="audio-file.mp3" controls>
    Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio> */
<p>
    Common Attributes
src: Specifies the URL of the audio file.

Example: <audio src="music.mp3"></audio>
controls: Displays built-in playback controls (play, pause, volume).

Example: <audio src="music.mp3" controls></audio>
autoplay: Automatically starts playing the audio when the page loads (note: may not work on all browsers due to user experience policies).

Example: <audio src="music.mp3" autoplay controls></audio>
loop: Causes the audio to start over again when it ends.

Example: <audio src="music.mp3" loop controls></audio>
muted: Mutes the audio by default.

Example: <audio src="music.mp3" muted controls></audio>
preload: Specifies how the audio file should be loaded. Options include none, metadata, and auto.

Example: <audio src="music.mp3" preload="auto" controls></audio>
    </p>
    <p>
        <video> Tag
            The <video> tag is used to embed video content in a webpage, supporting various formats like MP4, WebM, and Ogg.
        </p>
        <p>Basic Syntax</p>
        /* <video src="video-file.mp4" controls>
    Your browser does not support the video element.
</video> */
<p>
    Common Attributes
src: Specifies the URL of the video file.

Example: <video src="movie.mp4"></video>
controls: Displays built-in video playback controls (play, pause, volume).

Example: <video src="movie.mp4" controls></video>
autoplay: Automatically starts playing the video when the page loads (similar limitations as with audio).

Example: <video src="movie.mp4" autoplay controls></video>
loop: Causes the video to start over again when it ends.

Example: <video src="movie.mp4" loop controls></video>
muted: Mutes the video by default.

Example: <video src="movie.mp4" muted controls></video>
poster: Specifies an image to be shown while the video is downloading or until the user hits the play button.

Example: <video src="movie.mp4" poster="thumbnail.jpg" controls></video>
preload: Specifies how the video file should be loaded. Options include none, metadata, and auto.

Example: <video src="movie.mp4" preload="auto" controls></video>
    </p>
    <p>Example of Using <audio> and <video></p>


    <title>Audio and Video Example</title>


    <h1>Audio Player</h1>
    <audio src="audio-file.mp3" controls autoplay loop>
        Your browser does not support the audio element.
    </audio>

    <h1>Video Player</h1>
    <video src="video-file.mp4" controls poster="thumbnail.jpg" autoplay loop>
        Your browser does not support the video element.
    </video>


   <p>
    The <audio> tag allows you to embed sound files, while the <video> tag lets you embed video files.
Both tags support attributes like controls, autoplay, loop, muted, and preload to control playback behavior.
By using these tags, you can create rich multimedia experiences directly within your web pages without needing additional plugins.
    </p>


    <!--23/Explain the <picture> tag and its usage in responsive design-->
        <p>

The <picture> tag in HTML is a powerful element used for responsive images. It allows you to provide multiple sources for an image, enabling the browser to choose the most appropriate one based on the device’s characteristics, such as screen size, resolution, and orientation. This helps optimize image loading, improving performance and user experience on different devices.
            </p>
            <p>
                Basic Structure of the <picture> Tag
                    The <picture> tag typically contains one or more <source> elements followed by an <img> element. The browser will use the first source that matches the provided conditions
                </p>
                <p>
                    Example Structure 
                    </p>
                    /* <picture>
    <source media="(min-width: 800px)" srcset="large-image.jpg">
    <source media="(min-width: 400px)" srcset="medium-image.jpg">
    <img src="small-image.jpg" alt="Description of the image">
</picture> */
     <p>
        How It Works
<source> Elements: Each <source> element specifies a media condition and an image file via the srcset attribute. The browser checks the media conditions in the order they are defined and selects the first one that matches.

media: A media query that determines when the source is applicable (e.g., screen width).
srcset: Specifies the URL of the image to use when the media condition is met.
<img> Element: The <img> tag acts as a fallback. It is displayed if none of the <source> conditions are met. It’s also a good practice to include the alt attribute for accessibility.
        </p>
        <p>
            Benefits of Using the <picture> Tag
Responsive Images: It allows you to serve different images based on the user's screen size or resolution, ensuring that images are optimized for various devices.
Performance: By loading smaller images for smaller screens, you reduce the amount of data transferred, improving load times.
Art Direction: You can serve different images entirely based on the layout, such as using a different image for mobile vs. desktop.
            </p>
            <p>Example of Using the <picture> Tag
                Here’s a more detailed example that demonstrates the use of the <picture> tag:</p>

                    /* <picture>
    <source media="(min-width: 800px)" srcset="large-image.jpg">
    <source media="(min-width: 400px)" srcset="medium-image.jpg">
    <img src="small-image.jpg" alt="A beautiful landscape">
</picture> */
     <p>
        How It Works in This Example
If the viewport width is 800 pixels or wider, the browser will load large-image.jpg.
If the viewport width is between 400 and 800 pixels, the browser will load medium-image.jpg.
If the viewport width is less than 400 pixels, the browser will load small-image.jpg.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <picture> tag is an essential tool in responsive design, allowing developers to provide multiple image sources for different screen sizes and resolutions. By leveraging the <picture> tag, you can ensure that your images are optimized for performance and provide a better user experience across a wide range of devices.

Embed a responsive YouTube video using the <iframe> tag.
        </p>
        <p>
            To embed a responsive YouTube video using the <iframe> tag, you can use CSS to ensure the video adjusts to different screen sizes. Below is an example of how to achieve this, along with the HTML structure for the embedded video.
            </p>
            <title>Responsive YouTube Video</title>
    <style>
        .video-container {
            position: relative;
            overflow: hidden;
            padding-top: 56.25%; /* 16:9 Aspect Ratio */
            max-width: 100%; /* Ensures the video is responsive */
            height: 0;
        }
        .video-container iframe {
            position: absolute;
            top: 0;
            left: 0;
            width: 100%;
            height: 100%;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>

<h1>Responsive YouTube Video</h1>
<div class="video-container">
    <iframe 
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID" 
        frameborder="0" 
        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" 
        allowfullscreen>
    </iframe>
</div>

   <p>
    Explanation
Container:

The .video-container div is used to create a responsive aspect ratio for the video. The padding-top of 56.25% maintains a 16:9 aspect ratio (common for YouTube videos). The max-width: 100% ensures the video does not exceed the width of its parent container.
Iframe:

The <iframe> tag contains the URL to the YouTube video, which you need to replace with the actual video ID (VIDEO_ID).
You can find this ID in the YouTube video URL, typically following v=. For example, in the URL https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ, the video ID is dQw4w9WgXcQ.
The allowfullscreen attribute allows the video to be viewed in full-screen mode.
   </p>
   <p>
    Result
    This code will render a responsive YouTube video on your webpage, which will scale appropriately based on the size of the screen or container it is placed in.
   </p>

    <h1>Collapsible/Expandable Section</h1>
    
    <details>
        <summary>What is HTML?</summary>
        <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It describes the structure of a webpage using elements represented by tags.</p>
    </details>
    
    <details>
        <summary>What is CSS?</summary>
        <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML. It controls the layout, colors, fonts, and overall visual appearance of web pages.</p>
    </details>
    
    <details>
        <summary>What is JavaScript?</summary>
        <p>JavaScript is a programming language commonly used in web development. It allows for dynamic content, control of multimedia, and the ability to create interactive web applications.</p>
    </details>
    <p>
        Explanation
<details> Tag: This tag creates a disclosure widget from which users can obtain additional information or controls. By default, the content inside the <details> tag is hidden.

<summary> Tag: This tag defines a summary or heading for the <details> content. It is the part that is always visible and acts as the clickable element to expand or collapse the content.

Styling:

The cursor: pointer; style is added to the <summary> tag to indicate that it can be clicked.
font-weight: bold; makes the summary text stand out.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you implement this code, users will see a list of questions (or summaries) that they can click to reveal or hide the corresponding answers. This creates a clean and organized way to present information, especially when there are multiple sections of content that can be expanded or collapsed.

    <!--27/Create a simple navigation bar using <nav>, <ul>, and <li> tags with three links.-->
        <p>
            Here's a simple example of a navigation bar created using the <nav>, <ul>, and <li> tags. This navigation bar includes three links and is styled for a clean, basic layout.
        </p>

        <title>Simple Navigation Bar</title>
        <style>
            body {
                font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
                margin: 0;
                padding: 0;
            }
            nav {
                background-color: #333; /* Dark background for the nav */
                padding: 10px 20px; /* Padding around the nav */
            }
            nav ul {
                list-style-type: none; /* Remove bullet points */
                margin: 0; /* Remove default margin */
                padding: 0; /* Remove default padding */
                display: flex; /* Display items in a row */
            }
            nav li {
                margin-right: 20px; /* Space between links */
            }
            nav a {
                color: white; /* White text color */
                text-decoration: none; /* Remove underline */
                font-weight: bold; /* Bold text */
            }
            nav a:hover {
                text-decoration: underline; /* Underline on hover */
            }
        </style>
    </head>
    <body>
    
    <nav>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#home">Home</a></li>
            <li><a href="#about">About</a></li>
            <li><a href="#services">Services</a></li>
        </ul>
    </nav>
    
    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    <p>This is a simple navigation bar example.</p>

    <p>
        Explanation
HTML Structure:

The <nav> tag wraps the navigation section, indicating that this part of the page contains navigation links.
The <ul> tag is used to create an unordered list, which is a common structure for navigation menus.
Each <li> (list item) contains an <a> (anchor) tag that represents a link.
    </p>
    <p>
        Styling:

       The nav background color is set to dark gray (#333), and padding is added for spacing.
       The ul has its default styles removed (no bullets, margins, or padding) and uses flex for a horizontal layout.
       li items have margin-right to space them out.
       The a tags are styled with white color and no text decoration, with a hover effect to underline the text when hovered over.
    </p>
    <p>
        This code will create a simple, clean navigation bar at the top of the page with three links: Home, About, and Services. The links are styled for better visibility and usability, providing a good user experience.
    </p>

        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th rowspan="2">Product</th>
                <th colspan="3">Sales Data</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>

            </tr>
        </tfoot>
    </table>
    <p>
        Explanation
Table Structure:

     <caption>: Provides a title for the table, which is useful for context and accessibility.
     <thead>: Contains the header section of the table, where column headings are defined. Here, the first row contains a cell that spans two rows (rowspan="2") and a cell that spans three columns (colspan="3").
     <tbody>: Contains the main content of the table. Each product has its sales data listed in rows.
     <tfoot>: Contains the footer of the table, which summarizes or totals the data. In this case, it shows the total sales for each month.
    </p>
    <p>
        Merged Cells:

       The product names use <th> elements for semantic clarity and accessibility.
       The total sales for "Product C" are displayed in a single cell that spans three columns using colspan="3".
    </p>
    <p>
        Styling:

       The table uses border-collapse: collapse; for a cleaner look, where borders are merged together.
       The thead has a light background color to differentiate the header from the body of the table.
    </p>
    <p>
        This code will render a well-structured table that presents sales data for different products over three months, with clear headings, total sales calculations, and merged cells for enhanced readability. This layout is not only visually organized but also accessible to screen readers and assistive technologies.

    <title>Simple Webpage Layout</title>
    <style>
        body {
            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
            margin: 0;
            padding: 0;
        }
        header {
            background-color: #4CAF50; /* Green background for header */
            color: white; /* White text color */
            padding: 20px;
            text-align: center;
        }
        main {
            padding: 20px; /* Padding for the main content */
        }
        footer {
            background-color: #333; /* Dark background for footer */
            color: white; /* White text color */
            text-align: center;
            padding: 10px;
            position: relative; /* To position the footer */
            bottom: 0;
            width: 100%; /* Full width */
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>

<header>
    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    <nav>
        <ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0;">
            <li><a href="#home" style="color: white; text-decoration: none;">Home</a></li>
            <li><a href="#about" style="color: white; text-decoration: none;">About</a></li>
            <li><a href="#contact" style="color: white; text-decoration: none;">Contact</a></li>
        </ul>
    </nav>
</header>

<main>
    <h2>About This Page</h2>
    <p>This is a simple webpage layout using HTML semantic tags. The layout includes a header, main content area, and footer, making it easy to structure content logically.</p>

    <h2>Content Section</h2>
    <p>Here you can add more content, images, or sections as needed.</p>
</main>

<footer>
    <p>&copy; 2024 My Website. All rights reserved.</p>
</footer>
<p>
    Explanation
    Header:

    The <header> tag contains the main title of the webpage and a navigation menu. The navigation uses an unordered list (<ul>) to list links, which are styled for a cleaner look.
    Main Section:

     The <main> tag encapsulates the primary content of the page. It includes headings and paragraphs that describe the purpose of the webpage.
     Footer:

      The <footer> tag includes copyright information. It’s styled to stand out with a dark background and centered text.
</p>
<p>
    Styling:
    Basic CSS is used to add colors, padding, and text alignment to enhance the visual presentation of the webpage.
    The navigation links in the header are styled to be white and free of underlines for a clean look. 
</p>
     <p>
        This code will create a straightforward and structured webpage layout that clearly separates the header, main content area, and footer, making it easy for users to navigate and read.

     <!--30/Write Your favourite 10 HTML Tags & Explain Us Why That’s Your favourite tags. -->
     <p>
        Here are ten of my favorite HTML tags, along with explanations of why they stand out:
     </p>
     <p>
        <header>:

            Why I like it: This tag semantically represents the header of a document or section. It helps in organizing content and improving accessibility. Using <header> makes it clear where the introductory content is located.
            <nav>:
            
            Why I like it: The <nav> tag specifically indicates a section of navigation links. It enhances both the structure and accessibility of a webpage, helping screen readers understand that these links are for navigation.
            <section>:
            
            Why I like it: This tag is used to define thematic sections within a document. It promotes semantic HTML, making the content more organized and easier to style, and helps with SEO by providing context.
            <article>:
            
            Why I like it: The <article> tag is perfect for self-contained content that could stand alone, such as blog posts or news articles. It enhances the meaning of the content and makes it easier for search engines to understand.
            <aside>:
            
            Why I like it: This tag is great for content that is tangentially related to the main content, like sidebars or related links. It helps in structuring the layout and provides context for auxiliary information.
            <footer>:
            
            Why I like it: The <footer> tag marks the footer of a document or section, where you might find copyright info or related links. It's essential for providing closure and summarizing content.
            <figure> and <figcaption>:
            
            Why I like it: These tags work together to provide semantic markup for images and their captions. They enhance the understanding of visual content by clearly linking images to their descriptions.
            <form>:
            
            Why I like it: The <form> tag is crucial for creating interactive web applications. It allows users to submit data, making it a fundamental part of any user interface.
            <table>:
            
            Why I like it: Tables are great for displaying structured data in a grid format. When used correctly with <thead>, <tbody>, and <tfoot>, they improve readability and organization of information.
            <details> and <summary>:
            
            Why I like it: These tags create collapsible content sections, which are useful for FAQs or additional information. They improve user experience by allowing users to expand and collapse content as needed.
     </p>
     <p>
        These tags not only enhance the structure and accessibility of HTML documents but also promote best practices in semantic web development. They help developers and users alike by making content more organized and easier to understand.
